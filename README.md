Writing on the Wall code for algorithm

This page is two tables - students and thesis sections

The first table shows the number of students, their 1st, 2nd, & 3rd choices, their friends, and the thesis they get enrolled in.

The second table shows the thesis sections, who teaches, how many students selected it as a first, second, and third choice, preferred students, and enrolled students

The current state of the algorithm is:

1. For each thesis section, if the number of first choices is less than or equal to the number of spots, accept those students.
